The current supported platforms:

Linux 

    It needs kernel 2.4 or higher and the libacl library installed (with
    development headers, if installing from rpm). The url is
    http://acl.bestbits.at if using for ext2/ext3 and JFS, and
    http://oss.sgi.com/projects/xfs/ if using for XFS.

    The level of compliance is level 2 (see IMPLEMENTATION).


FreeBSD

    The current tested version is 4.6. I hope to be able to test 5.0 after
    it's released.

    The level of compliance is level 1. I hope that in FreeBSD 5 they will
    improve.


For any other platform, volunteers are welcome. To add support, look
into setup.py at first and then into acl.c
